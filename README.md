# DaggerViewModelExperiment

**[DEPRECATED]**

This is a PoC example for app->activity->fragment subscoping with Subcomponents + ViewModel by SavedStateHandle (using AutoFactory). 

You shouldn't use this setup, because it breaks scoping. 

Refer to https://github.com/Zhuinden/jetpack-navigation-ftue-sample for a proper setup.
